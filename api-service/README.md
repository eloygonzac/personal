# Data Science & Machine Learning Portfolio 🚀

This repository contains my end-to-end data science projects, ranging from statistical analysis to model deployment.

## 📂 Project Structure

* **`api-service/`**: A production-ready **FastAPI** application that serves a trained Linear Regression model to predict sales/prices.
* **Notebooks (`.ipynb`)**: Detailed analysis including:
    * Linear Regression with Model Training.
    * ANOVA (One-way and Multifactorial).
    * XGBoost Model building.

## 🛠️ How to run the API locally

1. Navigate to the api directory:
   `cd api-service`
2. Install dependencies:
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Start the server:
   `uvicorn main:app --reload`
4. Access the interactive documentation at: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`
